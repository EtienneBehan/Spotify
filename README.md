# Spotify Analysis

6 weeks ago I began my journey both into coding and data analysis. 
After taking a course on Codecademy, I wanted to see what I could do with Python. 

I've been a music lover ever since I was a young kid and have used Spotify for the last 8 years. 
In this project, I requested my data from Spotify to find out more in depth details about my top artists and songs.
